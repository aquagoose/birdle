1. Type a word with your keyboard.
   Press backspace to correct yourself.

   If the word is not 5 letters long, the missing letters will flash red.
   If in normal or hard difficulty, the word will be validated against the dictionary.
   If the word is not in the dictionary, the whole word will flash red.

   You can see your time counting up in the top right corner.

In the bottom-right corner, you'll see a button, clicking it will change the difficulty.
Here are the available difficulty levels:

- Beginner: Gives you 9 rows, and does not check the word against the dictionary. You can enter any text you like.
- Easy: Gives you the standard 6 rows, but, like beginner, does not check the word against the dictionary.
- Normal: The standard 6 rows, and checks the word against the dictionary. If it is not in the dictionary, the word will flash red.
- Hard: Like normal, except you only have 5 rows.
